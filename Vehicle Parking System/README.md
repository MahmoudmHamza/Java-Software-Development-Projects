>**Brief**

Vehicle parking system is a console-based application that deals with vehicles, tickets and parking slots that controls how the car parking works. It's written in Java and applies OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Concepts.

>**Overview**

When the program starts, the user has 2 options:

* **Park the car**: Registers the car into the parking system.
* **Release the car**: Checks out the car

When the user selects **Park** option, he will be asked to fill the following properties:

* Car's **type**.
* Car's **color**.
* Car's **number**.

After that the program will check for an available slot that fits the user's car and creates a ticket with info he entered as well as the slot number where he parked. If the program couldn't find a slot for the user's car, it will display a message to inform him.

When the user selects **Release** option, he should enter slot number assigned in his ticket to check for his car.
