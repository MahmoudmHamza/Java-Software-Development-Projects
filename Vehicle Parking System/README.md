>**Brief**

Vehicle parking system is a console-based application that deals with vehicles, tickets and parking slots that controls how the car parking works. It's written in Java and applies OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Concepts.

>**Project Concept**

When the program starts, the user has 2 options:

* Park the car: Registers the car into the parking system.
* Release the car: Checks out the car

When the user selects "Park" option, he will be asked to fill the following properties:

* Car's type.
* Car's color.
* Car's number.

After that the program will check for an available slot that fits the user's car. If the program couldn't find a slot for the user's car, it will display a message to inform him.
